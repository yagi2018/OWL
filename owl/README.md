# 🛠️ Installation

OWL supports multiple installation methods to fit your workflow preferences. Choose the option that works best for you.

## Option 1: Using uv (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone github repo
git clone https://github.com/camel-ai/owl.git

# Change directory into project directory
cd owl

# Install uv if you don't have it already
pip install uv

# Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
# We support using Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
uv venv .venv --python=3.10

# Activate the virtual environment
# For macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# For Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install CAMEL with all dependencies
uv pip install -e .

# Exit the virtual environment when done

```

## Option 2: Using venv and pip

```bash
# Clone github repo
git clone https://github.com/camel-ai/owl.git

# Change directory into project directory
cd owl

# Create a virtual environment
# For Python 3.10 (also works with 3.11, 3.12)
python3.10 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# For macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# For Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

```

## Option 3: Using conda

```bash
# Clone github repo
git clone https://github.com/camel-ai/owl.git

# Change directory into project directory
cd owl

# Create a conda environment
conda create -n owl python=3.10

# Activate the conda environment
conda activate owl

# Option 1: Install as a package (recommended)
pip install -e .

# Option 2: Install from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Exit the conda environment when done
conda deactivate
```

## **Setup Environment Variables**

OWL requires various API keys to interact with different services. The `owl/.env_template` file contains placeholders for all necessary API keys along with links to the services where you can register for them.

### Option 1: Using a `.env` File (Recommended)

1. **Copy and Rename the Template**:
   ```bash
   cd owl
   cp .env_template .env
   ```

2. **Configure Your API Keys**:
   Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and insert your API keys in the corresponding fields.
   
   > **Note**: For the minimal example (`run_mini.py`), you only need to configure the LLM API key (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

### Option 2: Setting Environment Variables Directly

Alternatively, you can set environment variables directly in your terminal:

- **macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh)**:
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
  ```

- **Windows (Command Prompt)**:
  ```batch
  set OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
  ```

- **Windows (PowerShell)**:
  ```powershell
  $env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key-here"
  ```

> **Note**: Environment variables set directly in the terminal will only persist for the current session.



## **Running with Docker**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/camel-ai/owl.git
cd owl

# Configure environment variables
cp owl/.env_template owl/.env
# Edit the .env file and fill in your API keys


# Option 1: Using docker-compose directly
cd .container
docker-compose up -d
# Run OWL inside the container
docker-compose exec owl bash -c "xvfb-python run.py"

# Option 2: Build and run using the provided scripts
cd .container
chmod +x build_docker.sh
./build_docker.sh
# Run OWL inside the container
./run_in_docker.sh "your question"
```

For more detailed Docker usage instructions, including cross-platform support, optimized configurations, and troubleshooting, please refer to [DOCKER_README.md](.container/DOCKER_README_en.md).

# 🚀 Quick Start

After installation and setting up your environment variables, you can start using OWL right away:

```bash
python owl/run.py
```

## Running with Different Models

### Model Requirements

- **Tool Calling**: OWL requires models with robust tool calling capabilities to interact with various toolkits. Models must be able to understand tool descriptions, generate appropriate tool calls, and process tool outputs.

- **Multimodal Understanding**: For tasks involving web interaction, image analysis, or video processing, models with multimodal capabilities are required to interpret visual content and context.

#### Supported Models

For information on configuring AI models, please refer to our [CAMEL models documentation](https://docs.camel-ai.org/key_modules/models.html#supported-model-platforms-in-camel).

> **Note**: For optimal performance, we strongly recommend using OpenAI models (GPT-4 or later versions). Our experiments show that other models may result in significantly lower performance on complex tasks and benchmarks, especially those requiring advanced multi-modal understanding and tool use.

OWL supports various LLM backends, though capabilities may vary depending on the model's tool calling and multimodal abilities. You can use the following scripts to run with different models:

```bash
# Run with Qwen model
python owl/run_qwen_zh.py

# Run with Deepseek model
python owl/run_deepseek_zh.py

# Run with other OpenAI-compatible models
python owl/run_openai_compatiable_model.py

# Run with Ollama
python owl/run_ollama.py
```

For a simpler version that only requires an LLM API key, you can try our minimal example:

```bash
python owl/run_mini.py
```

You can run OWL agent with your own task by modifying the `run.py` script:

```python
# Define your own task
question = "Task description here."

society = construct_society(question)
answer, chat_history, token_count = run_society(society)

print(f"\033[94mAnswer: {answer}\033[0m")
```

For uploading files, simply provide the file path along with your question:

```python
# Task with a local file (e.g., file path: `tmp/example.docx`)
question = "What is in the given DOCX file? Here is the file path: tmp/example.docx"

society = construct_society(question)
answer, chat_history, token_count = run_society(society)
print(f"\033[94mAnswer: {answer}\033[0m")
```

OWL will then automatically invoke document-related tools to process the file and extract the answer.


### Example Tasks

Here are some tasks you can try with OWL:

- "Find the latest stock price for Apple Inc."
- "Analyze the sentiment of recent tweets about climate change"
- "Help me debug this Python code: [your code here]"
- "Summarize the main points from this research paper: [paper URL]"
- "Create a data visualization for this dataset: [dataset path]"

# 🧰 Toolkits and Capabilities

> **Important**: Effective use of toolkits requires models with strong tool calling capabilities. For multimodal toolkits (Web, Image, Video), models must also have multimodal understanding abilities.

OWL supports various toolkits that can be customized by modifying the `tools` list in your script:

```python
# Configure toolkits
tools = [
    *WebToolkit(headless=False).get_tools(),  # Browser automation
    *VideoAnalysisToolkit(model=models["video"]).get_tools(),
    *AudioAnalysisToolkit().get_tools(),  # Requires OpenAI Key
    *CodeExecutionToolkit(sandbox="subprocess").get_tools(),
    *ImageAnalysisToolkit(model=models["image"]).get_tools(),
    SearchToolkit().search_duckduckgo,
    SearchToolkit().search_google,  # Comment out if unavailable
    SearchToolkit().search_wiki,
    *ExcelToolkit().get_tools(),
    *DocumentProcessingToolkit(model=models["document"]).get_tools(),
    *FileWriteToolkit(output_dir="./").get_tools(),
]
```

## Available Toolkits

Key toolkits include:

### Multimodal Toolkits (Require multimodal model capabilities)
- **WebToolkit**: Browser automation for web interaction and navigation
- **VideoAnalysisToolkit**: Video processing and content analysis
- **ImageAnalysisToolkit**: Image analysis and interpretation

### Text-Based Toolkits
- **AudioAnalysisToolkit**: Audio processing (requires OpenAI API)
- **CodeExecutionToolkit**: Python code execution and evaluation
- **SearchToolkit**: Web searches (Google, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia)
- **DocumentProcessingToolkit**: Document parsing (PDF, DOCX, etc.)

Additional specialized toolkits: ArxivToolkit, GitHubToolkit, GoogleMapsToolkit, MathToolkit, NetworkXToolkit, NotionToolkit, RedditToolkit, WeatherToolkit, and more. For a complete list, see the [CAMEL toolkits documentation](https://docs.camel-ai.org/key_modules/tools.html#built-in-toolkits).

## Customizing Your Configuration

To customize available tools:

```python
# 1. Import toolkits
from camel.toolkits import WebToolkit, SearchToolkit, CodeExecutionToolkit

# 2. Configure tools list
tools = [
    *WebToolkit(headless=True).get_tools(),
    SearchToolkit().search_wiki,
    *CodeExecutionToolkit(sandbox="subprocess").get_tools(),
]

# 3. Pass to assistant agent
assistant_agent_kwargs = {"model": models["assistant"], "tools": tools}
```

Selecting only necessary toolkits optimizes performance and reduces resource usage.

# 🌐 Web Interface

OWL includes an intuitive web-based user interface that makes it easier to interact with the system. 

## Starting the Web UI

```bash
# Start the Chinese version
python run_app_zh.py

# Start the English version
python run_app.py
```

## Features

- **Easy Model Selection**: Choose between different models (OpenAI, Qwen, DeepSeek, etc.)
- **Environment Variable Management**: Configure your API keys and other settings directly from the UI
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Communicate with OWL agents through a user-friendly interface
- **Task History**: View the history and results of your interactions

The web interface is built using Gradio and runs locally on your machine. No data is sent to external servers beyond what's required for the model API calls you configure.

# 🧪 Experiments

To reproduce OWL's GAIA benchmark score of 58.18:

1. Switch to the `gaia58.18` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout gaia58.18
   ```

2. Run the evaluation script:
   ```bash
   python run_gaia_roleplaying.py
   ```

This will execute the same configuration that achieved our top-ranking performance on the GAIA benchmark.

# ⏱️ Future Plans

We're continuously working to improve OWL. Here's what's on our roadmap:

- [ ] Write a technical blog post detailing our exploration and insights in multi-agent collaboration in real-world tasks
- [ ] Enhance the toolkit ecosystem with more specialized tools for domain-specific tasks
- [ ] Develop more sophisticated agent interaction patterns and communication protocols
- [ ] Improve performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks

# ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why don't I see Chrome running locally after starting the example script?**

A: If OWL determines that a task can be completed using non-browser tools (such as search or code execution), the browser will not be launched. The browser window will only appear when OWL determines that browser-based interaction is necessary.

**Q: Which Python version should I use?**

A: OWL supports Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. 

**Q: How can I contribute to the project?**

A: See our [Contributing](#-contributing) section for details on how to get involved. We welcome contributions of all kinds, from code improvements to documentation updates.
